    <h1>Titanic Survival Prediction Model</h1>
    <p>This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a step-by-step process for creating a model to predict the survival of passengers in the Titanic Disaster.</p>
<p> The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 was a tragic event that claimed the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew members. By building a predictive model based on the available data, this project aims to shed light on the factors that may have influenced survival rates and potentially inform future disaster response efforts.</p>
    <p>Note: The training dataset is contained in train.csv, while the test dataset is contained in test.csv. The output file is submission.csv.</p>
